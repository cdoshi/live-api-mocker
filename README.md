# Live API Mocker

Test your code with real APIs providing your mock data. Once you submit the request with mock data, it is live instantly. No fuss.

## Getting Started

You can post your endpoint with the method type and mock data at https://live-api-mocker.herokuapp.com/

Since this site is open for anyone to submit and retrieve mock data, it is possible someone might over-write or even fetch your data. A typical sample url is https://live-api-mocker.herokuapp.com/my-account

My recommendation would be to use a cryptic prefix, to minimize this possibility
```
